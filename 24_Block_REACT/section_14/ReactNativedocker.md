## Running in EXPO

Expo will run on a node system within a docker container.  This includes all that is needed to support development (like a local snack) and a command line interpreter CLI which can be used to build the final product.


## Docker and Expo

To start off you can use github desktop to add a new repository, which I have named "native" and to publish this publically available on a github repository.

Ensure that docker is running but note that no containers are currently running.

Now I am going to open this into visual studio code and prepare an environment in a container.The developer environment can use an existing image and code placed on gitHub to create a volume which can be kept in synchronisation with gitHub by using git within visual studio or github desktop.

Open the empty "native" repository folder on visual studio code.

> CTRL + SHIFT + P

Navigate and select the required folder, "native".

Select "add configuration to the workspace"

Show all templates and select node and typescript.

This time I will select node version 2022 which will enter long term support October 2024.

When asked for additional features I note that the expo cli is available: I tried selecting this but it loaded an old version which was not compatible with node 22 so choose none I will leave this for later.

Press return and continue through the default selections to get the container downloading.


......

The file list will initially be quite sparse.

The container is running in the background.

To check that node is working enter into the terminal shell:

> node --version

```code
v22.2.0
```

Install expo.


> npm i expo


Check that yarn is installed

> yarn --version

```code
1.22.19
```

It seems that all the depependancies are in place now.  The state of package.json indicates the dependancies which have been met.

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "expo": "^51.0.38"
  }
}
```

# Building the project

Can the project be built now?  In the development environment bash shell:

> expo build:android

Seems the dependencies are not all there yet.

```code
Cannot determine which native SDK version your project uses because the module `expo` is not installed. Please install it with `yarn add expo` and try again.
```
Follow these instructions:

> yarn add expo

This seems to repeat some of the actions already done. However the code runs.

```code
 yarn add expo
yarn add v1.22.19

# Conclusion

It took a lot of effort to build a docker environment which could build a mobile application.  However, from this point all we need to do is update the github and synchronise and we have the ready made development environment to generate many apps.

As long as expo SDK46 is selected this should work without much update for around a year.
