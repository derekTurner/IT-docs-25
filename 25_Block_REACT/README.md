# Using React for client side applications

React is a javaScript/typeScript framework which is normally used to generate client side User Interfaces for web apps.  

At the time of writing React has moved to an new domain and [the website](https://react.dev/) includes notes which are based on the modern coding approach of hooks and functions.

The development of coding moves quickly and there are many new approaches including new frameworks and runtime environments.  In these notes we will use react with express, but you are encouraged to consider the wider range of current programming approaches.

We will use react as a client side application.

The old version of the react documentation based on React 18.2.0 is still available on the web as a legacy and you should not use [this site](https://legacy.reactjs.org/) in error.
